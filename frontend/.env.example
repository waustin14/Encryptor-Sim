# API Configuration (HTTPS)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:443/api/v1

# Development: Vite proxy handles HTTPS with secure: false for self-signed certs.
# Production: Frontend served by FastAPI on same origin; relative URLs use HTTPS automatically.
#
# Certificate Trust for Local Development:
# 1. Backend generates self-signed cert at /etc/encryptor-sim/tls/server.crt
# 2. Vite proxy accepts self-signed cert via secure: false
# 3. Browser will show certificate warning on direct HTTPS access - accept to proceed
# 4. For automated testing, use NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 (dev only)
