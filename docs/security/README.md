# Security Scan Artifacts (Placeholders)

Raw scan outputs will be stored here after the appliance image is available for lab testing.

Expected files (timestamped, UTC in ISO-8601 format):

- `docs/security/nmap-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.txt`
- `docs/security/zap-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.html`
- `docs/security/sqlmap-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ/`

These artifacts are pending until the virtual image packaging step is complete.
